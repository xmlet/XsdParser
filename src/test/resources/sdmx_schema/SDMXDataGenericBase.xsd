    <xs:documentation>The base generic data module contains the descriptions of base generic data
      set format. The data set defined here describes the structure of the data set in all generic
      data messages. Any generic data messages must derive the data set from this format.

  <xs:complexType name="DataSetType">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>DataSetType defines the structure of the generic data set. Data is organised
        into either a collection of series (grouped observations) or a collection of un-grouped
        observations. The organisation used is dependent on the structure specification in the
        header of the data message (which is referenced via the structureRef attribute). The
        structure specification states which data occurs at the observation level. If this dimension
        is "AllDimensions" then the data set must consist of a collection of un-grouped
        observations; otherwise the data set will contain a collection of series with the
        observations in the series disambiguated by the specified dimension at the observation
        level. This data set is capable of containing data (observed values) and/or documentation
        (attribute values). It is assumed that each series or un-grouped observation will be
        distinct in its purpose. For example, if series contains both data and documentation, it
        assumed that each series will have a unique key. If the series contains only data or only
        documentation, then it is possible that another series with the same key might exist, but
        with not with the same purpose (i.e. to provide data or documentation) as the first series.
