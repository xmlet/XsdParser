    <xs:appinfo>SDMX Core Time Series Structure Specific Data Module</xs:appinfo>
    <xs:documentation>The core time series structure specific data module contains the descriptions
      of a derivation of the base structure specific data set format which only allows for data
      organised as time series. A data set structure specific according to the data set defined here
      is a valid base structure specific data set, and can be processed using the same rules as
      those for the base format. The difference in this structure is that the data is assured to be
      organised as time series. This allows for variations of the structure specific data message
      which restrict the data to only be formatted as time series. The entire structure declared for
      the is data set is abstract, meaning that instances will have to be based on types derived
      from these structures in schemas created based on the details data structure definition.

  <xs:complexType name="TimeSeriesDataSetType" abstract="true">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>TimeSeriesDataSetType is the abstract type which defines the base structure
        for any data structure definition specific time series based data set. A derived data set
        type will be created that is specific to a data structure definition. Unlike the base
        format, only one variation of this is allowed for a data structure definition. This
        variation is the time dimension as the observation dimension. Data is organised into a
        collection of time series. Because this derivation is achieved using restriction, data sets
        conforming to this type will inherently conform to the base data set structure as well. In
        fact, data structure specific here will be identical to data in the base data set when the
        time dimension is the observation dimension, even for the derived data set types. This means
        that the data contained in this structure can be processed in exactly the same manner as the
        base structure. The same rules for derivation as the base data set type apply to this
        specialized data set.

    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>TimeSeriesType defines an abstract structure which is used to group a
        collection of observations which have a key in common, organised by time. The key for a
        series is every dimension defined in the data structure definition, save the time dimension.
        In addition to observations, values can be provided for attributes which are associated with
        the dimensions which make up this series key (so long as the attributes do not specify a
        group attachment or also have an relationship with the time dimension). It is possible for
        the series to contain only observations or only attribute values, or both. The same rules
        for derivation as the base series type apply to this specialized series.

      <xs:documentation>TimeSeriesObsType defines the abstract structure of a time series
        observation. The observation must be provided a value for the time dimension. This time
        value should disambiguate the observation within the series in which it is defined (i.e.
        there should not be another observation with the same time value). The observation can
        contain an observed value and/or attribute values. The same rules for derivation as the base
        observation type apply to this specialized observation.

            <xs:documentation>The TIME_PERIOD attribute is an explicit attribute for the time
              dimension. This is declared in the base schema since it has a fixed identifier and
              representation. Since this data is structured to be time series only, this attribute
              is always required. If the time dimension specifies a more specific representation of
              time the derived type will restrict the type definition to the appropriate type.
