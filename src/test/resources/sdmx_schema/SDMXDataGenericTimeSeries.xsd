    <xs:appinfo>SDMX Time Series Generic Data Module</xs:appinfo>
    <xs:documentation>The time series generic data module contains the descriptions of a derivation
      of the base generic data set format which only allows for data organised as time series. A
      data set structured according to the data set defined here is a valid base generic data set,
      and can be processed using the same rules as those for the base format. The difference in this
      structure is that the data is assured to be organised as time series. This allows for
      variations of the generic data message which restrict the data to only be formatted as time
      series.

  <xs:complexType name="TimeSeriesDataSetType">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>TimeSeriesDataSetType is a derivation of the base DataSetType of the generic
        format the restricts the data set to only allow for grouped observations where the dimension
        at the observation level is the time dimension of the data structure definition. This means
        that unlike the base data set structure, there can be no un-grouped observations. Because
        this derivation is achieved using restriction, data sets conforming to this type will
        inherently conform to the base data set structure as well. In fact, data structured here
        will be identical to data in the base data set when the time dimension is the observation
        dimension. This means that the data contained in this structure can be processed in exactly
        the same manner as the base structure.
